Exercise: 

Create a trivia game with multiple choice questions and with a timer that counts down all the wall from 60 seconds to zero, then calculates the score of the questions answered correctly. If the person loses the game will reset 

What needs to be coded: 

1) create html the page which includes the questions, choices, and place for the timer (check)
2) create an object to hold the number for the timer and test that the timer is working (check. Changed this section to timeout but now trying to work on the timer to ensure that it countsdown in real time)
3) create an property within the object to hold the score (check)
4) create some sort of validation for the answers and ensure that they are correct 
5) create some sort of array that will hold all the answers for the true/false questions 




Incremental pieces:
1) create html the page which includes the questions, choices, and place for the timer (completed)
    -Use a set of three test questions and see if you can get the questions to appear first (check)
    -get background to work as expected (check)
    -get reset.css working (check)
    -Make the html and css scalable where it can work on any device (check)
    -get the buttons to be centered on the the form and get them to work (check)
2) create an object to hold the number for the timer and test that the timer is working (check. Changed this section to timeout but now trying to work on the timer to ensure that it countsdown in real time)
    -get timer to countdown (check)
    -get timer to reset itself and work again (check)
    -get a reset in place where the timer resets itself back to 60 seconds when game finishes and shows score (in-progress)
    -change from timeout to actual realtime timer to ensure that it works as expected and shows the timer counting down from 60 to 0 (check)
3) create an property within the object to hold the score (in-progress)
    -make property and make sure it shows alert with the actual score (check)
    -apply values to eat of the questions and make it show a real-life score at the end 
4) create some sort of validation for the answers and ensure that they are correct 
    -make sure the answers have a point value of some kind 
    -make sure the answers are validated against an array 
5) create some sort of array that will hold all the answers for the true/false questions
